# MindForge Roadmap

This roadmap tracks product direction and explicit non-goals. Completed release details are summarized in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md); current completion state is in [ROADMAP_PROGRESS.md](./ROADMAP_PROGRESS.md).

## Current Position

Current version: **v0.5.2**.

MindForge v0.x is a local-first CLI for personal learning memory:

- local source ingestion through adapters;
- five-stage LLM processing with safe fake default;
- explicit human approval;
- local lexical/hybrid recall;
- local review planning;
- project context packs;
- local-only telemetry;
- CLI onboarding and demo vault.
- read-only Obsidian Binding / Bridge.
- Local Usability as a formal milestone.
- packaged default prompts, templates, and configs.

## Completed v0.4.3 Follow-Up

The docs cleanup after v0.4.3 is complete: active docs were consolidated into
user, developer, roadmap, changelog, and archive layers. Historical milestone
reviews and superseded design notes now live under `docs/archive/`.

## v0.5 Completed

v0.5 implements the minimal safe Obsidian bridge:

- configure an Obsidian vault path;
- scan Markdown read-only;
- parse frontmatter, tags, `[[wikilinks]]`, and directory structure;
- introduce `ObsidianVaultSourceAdapter` in the SourceAdapter system;
- add `mindforge obsidian doctor|scan|links|stage`;
- write candidate output only to Obsidian staging/review;
- never modify real vault source notes in the first phase;
- keep machine indexes, caches, runtime logs, and intermediate state in derived
  layers such as `.mindforge/`, SQLite, vector stores, or graph stores rather
  than formal Obsidian notes.

## v0.5.1 Local Usability Completed

v0.5.1 promotes **Local Usability / 本地友好使用** to a first-class roadmap
milestone. It is not a new feature class, not RAG, and not an Obsidian plugin.
The goal is to let a local user complete the loop from initialization to
knowledge use with fake/offline defaults and clear next actions.

Acceptance criteria:

- initialize with `mindforge init` or `mindforge init --interactive`;
- check health with `mindforge doctor`;
- discover next actions with `mindforge next`;
- discover commands with `mindforge commands`;
- add demo markdown / webclip / chat export sources;
- scan with `mindforge scan`;
- process with `mindforge process --profile fake`;
- inspect drafts with `mindforge approve list`;
- manually approve with `mindforge approve --card ...`;
- rebuild search with `mindforge index rebuild`;
- recall with `mindforge recall --query ...`;
- review with `mindforge review weekly` and `mindforge review schedule`;
- generate project context with `mindforge project context ...`;
- use the read-only Obsidian bridge with
  `mindforge obsidian doctor|scan|links|stage --dry-run`.

v0.5.1 also accepts the user-natural `mindforge next --vault PATH` form for
non-Obsidian commands, fixes command-map rendering for `[[wikilinks]]`, avoids
reading `.env` in the fake-provider local smoke path, and makes fake-provider
demo output inherit source titles instead of producing `Untitled` cards.

## v0.5.2 Packaging / Install Readiness Completed

v0.5.2 keeps the v0.5.1 local product loop intact while removing a packaged
install footgun: runtime defaults no longer assume a source checkout or repo
root current directory.

Completed scope:

- default prompts are bundled under `src/mindforge/assets/prompts/`;
- default Knowledge Card template is bundled under
  `src/mindforge/assets/templates/`;
- default configs used by `mindforge init` and default learning tracks are
  bundled under `src/mindforge/assets/configs/`;
- default asset loading uses `importlib.resources`;
- explicit user paths such as `--prompts-dir`, `--tracks`, and `--template`
  still take priority;
- SourceAdapter, SourceDocument, processor, approval, and recall architecture
  remain unchanged.

Non-goals remain explicit: no RAG / embedding, no Obsidian plugin, no live LLM
default path, no real private vault processing, and no automatic approval.

## Near-Term Priority

Next: validate v0.5.2 on small, non-sensitive disposable vault copies and patch
install smoke / local usability issues before adding new feature classes.

## Future Candidate Work

See [M5_BACKLOG.md](./M5_BACKLOG.md) for current spike candidates. The active future set is intentionally small:

- Obsidian Binding polish from dry-run feedback.
- Local Usability polish from real non-sensitive dogfooding.
- Install smoke polish after packaged asset migration.
- PDF/docx performance baselines.
- More onboarding and cross-platform terminal polish.
- RAG / embedding only as a later design spike if lexical recall proves
  insufficient after Obsidian binding.

## Explicit Non-Goals For v0.x

- No OCR.
- No remote telemetry.
- No cloud sync.
- No automatic approval.
- No background daemon.
- No system calendar or notification integration.
- No SM-2 / FSRS automation.
- No RAG/embedding in mainline without a separate design and review.
- No graph database or vector database implementation in v0.5.
- No automatic Obsidian vault reorganization.
- No automatic formal-note edits, file moves, or wikilink rewrites.
- No large-scale real-vault dogfooding before read-only Obsidian binding is
  designed and tested.
- No real LLM calls, `.env` reads, private data handling, or automatic approve
  in the local usability smoke path.
